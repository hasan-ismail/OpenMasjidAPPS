# OpenMasjidAPPS

The **app catalog** for [**OpenMasjidOS**](https://github.com/hasan-ismail/OpenMasjidOS) — a free,
self-hosted, masjid-themed platform for running Docker apps.

This repo is a **catalog only**. It does **not** hold app source code. Each app lives in its **own
repository**; this repo keeps a [`registry.yaml`](./registry.yaml) of those repos and generates the
single [`catalog.json`](./catalog.json) the platform fetches to populate its App Store.

> Building an app? Read **[docs/BUILDING_AN_APP.md](./docs/BUILDING_AN_APP.md)** (hands-on) and
> **[CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md)** (the authoritative contract).

## How it works

```
app repos (one per app) ──listed in──▶ registry.yaml ──build──▶ catalog.json ──fetched by──▶ OpenMasjidOS
```

- Each app is its **own public repo** with a `manifest.yaml`, a `docker-compose.yml`, an icon, and a
  publicly-published Docker image.
- `registry.yaml` lists those repos. `scripts/build-catalog.mjs` fetches each one and assembles
  `catalog.json` (repo root) — the **only** file the platform reads, from:
  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasan-ismail/OpenMasjidAPPS/main/catalog.json`
- The platform installs an app by running its `compose` as `docker compose -p omos-<id> up -d`,
  injecting the user's answers to the app's `settings` as environment variables.

## Adding an app

1. Build your app in its **own repo** — see [docs/BUILDING_AN_APP.md](./docs/BUILDING_AN_APP.md).
   (Fastest start: copy a folder from [`examples/`](./examples/) into a new repo and adapt it.)
2. Add an entry to [`registry.yaml`](./registry.yaml):
   ```yaml
   apps:
     - id: my-app
       repo: <owner>/openmasjid-my-app
       ref: v1.0.0
   ```
3. Regenerate the catalog (optional locally — CI does it on push):
   ```
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```
4. Open a PR. CI rebuilds and commits `catalog.json` automatically.

## `examples/`

Complete, working **reference apps** (`prayer-times-display`, `announcements-board`) you copy into a
new repo to start. They are templates/documentation — they are **not** part of the catalog (the
registry is).

## Licensing

This repository — the catalog tooling, registry, and example scaffolding — is licensed
**AGPL-3.0**, the same as the platform (see [LICENSE](./LICENSE)).

**Each app keeps its own license**, declared in its `manifest.yaml` `license` field. Apps run at
arm's length as separate containers, so they are not bound by this repo's license. Do not copy app
definitions or assets from umbrelOS or CasaOS — author them fresh. See [CLAUDE.md §10](./CLAUDE.md).
